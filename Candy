There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.


/**
 * @param {number[]} ratings
 * @return {number}
 */
var candy = function(ratings) {
    let candy = new Array(ratings.length).fill(1);

// left to right 
    for(let i=1;i<ratings.length;i++){
        if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1] && candy[i] <= candy[i-1]){
            candy[i]=candy[i-1]+1;
        }
    }

// right to left
    for(let i=ratings.length-2;i>=0;i--){
    if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1] && candy[i] <= candy[i+1]){
            candy[i]=candy[i+1]+1;
        }
    }

    let sum = candy.reduce((cur,acc)=> acc=cur+acc);
    return sum;
